Thank you for reading my thesis! This repository contains the data needed to replicate the analyses presented in my master's thesis on the impact of Oregonâ€™s Measure 110 on vehicle crash rates. The study uses a synthetic difference-in-differences (DID) approach and includes comparisons with traditional regression DID models. The Excel file contains data I manually collected by combing through crash reports produced by different Departments of Transportation. Please reach out to me with any questions or concerns at sfarnsworth@uchicago.edu.
